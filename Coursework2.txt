CREATE TABLE Statistic (
	wardId VARCHAR(10),
	occId INTEGER,
	gender INTEGER, -- 1 = female, 0 = male
	data INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY (wardId, occId, gender),
	FOREIGN KEY (wardId) REFERENCES Ward(code),
	FOREIGN KEY (occId) REFERENCES Occupation(id)
);


question 1;
SELECT data FROM Statistic WHERE wardId = 'E05001975'
AND occId = 7 AND gender = 1;

question 2;
SELECT sum(data) FROM Statistic WHERE wardId = 'E05000697'
AND occId = 5;

3. For the residents of Portland ward (E05008884), list how many people worked in each
class of occupation as a table with two columns num_people,occ_class. The
second column should contain the name (i.e. “Managers . . . ”) of the occupation class.

SELECT sum(data) as num_people,  name as occ_class FROM Occupation, Statistic WHERE Occupation.id = Statistic.occId and wardId = 'E05008884' group by occId;

4. Find the working population, code, ward name and county-level unit name (entry in
the county table) of the smallest ward by working population in the dataset. Hint: sort
on size and then take the first row to get the minimum.

// breaks it


-- the below does not work - after i tried to put county into it.
select

(select name from county) as county,

(select name from ward where ward.code = statistic.wardId) as place,

wardId,

sum(data) as total

from Statistic, Ward group by wardId order by total asc limit 1;

-- the below works but has no county
select
(select name
	from ward
	where ward.code = statistic.wardId) as place,
	wardId,
	sum(data) as total
from Statistic group by wardId order by total asc limit 1;


5. How many wards have at least 1000 working inhabitants?

-- first i need to aggregate all genders and professions. this could be done by grouping by first, instead of doing the where first.

select sum(data) from Statistic where data>1000 group by wardId;


--both the below work
select count(*) from (select sum(data) as dsum from Statistic group by wardId) as T where dsum>1000;

select count(*) from (select sum(data) from Statistic group by wardId having sum(data)>1000) as T;



select count(data) from Statistic where data>1000 group by wardId;

select count(data) from Statistic where data>1000 group by wardId; -- this counts how many wards are in each grouping. this is because of the relationship between count and group by.

6. Find the average size of a ward’s working population for each region
 of England. Your output should contain two columns called name,avg_size.
Hint: this one would be easy if you could use two queries and a temporary
 table. To do it in one query, use an inline view.

select region.name, avg(Statistic.data) as avg_size
from region, county, ward, Statistic
where region.code = county.parent
and county.code = ward.parent
and ward.code = statistic.wardId
group by region.name
limit 100;

question 7 -
For all county-level units (CLUs) in the North West region (E12000002),
produce a table in the following format

CLU occupation gender N
Cumbria 				Associate professional …		 female 10054
Lancashire 			Caring leisure …						 male 10088
Cheshire West … Sales and customer …				 female 10107
Cheshire East		 Associate professional … 	female 10178

with the following conditions:

• “N” is the number of residents of the given occupation class and
 gender in the given CLU.
• “gender” is the string ‘male’ or ‘female’.
• Ignore the “...” in the CLU and occupation columns, just return
 this from the table directly.
• The table is sorted by “N” and only values greater or equal
 to 10000 appear in the table.

select county.name, region.name, sum(Statistic.data) as CLU
from County, Region, Statistic
where  county.parent = region.code
and region.name = 'North West'
group by county.name
limit 100;


select Occupation.name, Statistic.gender, sum(Statistic.data), region.name
from Occupation, Statistic, Ward, County, Region
where Region.name = 'North West'
and statistic.wardId = Ward.code
and Ward.parent = County.code
and County.parent = Region.code
and Occupation.id = Statistic.occId
group by Occupation.name
limit 100;

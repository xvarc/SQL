i should check these work with 2015 too, and cross reference the answers with otto. either by writing them down or doing it in person. 

candidate = id, name, party, ward, votes

Party = id, name

ward = id, name, electorate


Problem 1

SELECT Party.name FROM Party;

Problem 2
select sum(Candidate.votes) from Candidate;
or
select sum(Candidate.votes) as SumOfVotes from Candidate;

Problem 3
//improvised this myself
select name,votes from Candidate where Candidate.ward = (select id from Ward where name = 'Bedminster');


Problem 4

how many votes, lib dems (party number) in filwood (ward number)

select sum(Candidate.votes) from Candidate where Candidate.ward = (select id from Ward where name = 'Filwood') and Candidate.party = (select id from Party where name = 'Liberal Democrat');

Problem 5
Produce a table with three columns called name, party, votes showing the
results for the Hengrove ward, ordered by number of votes (highest first).
The 2014 solution is:

select Candidate.name, Party.name, Candidate.votes from Candidate, Party where Candidate.party = Party.id and Candidate.ward = (select id from Ward where name = 'Hengrove') order by votes desc;

Problem 6
Which rank (1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd ...) did Labour end up in Bishopsworth?
Your solution should be a table with one row and one column containing the answer
as a number. Hint: count the number of parties that got the same number or more
votes than Labour. You may assume no ties.
The 2014 solution is 2 (Labour came second).

select count(votes) from Candidate where votes >= (select votes from Candidate where Candidate.party = (select id from Party where name = 'Labour') and Candidate.ward = (select id from Ward where name = 'Bishopsworth')) and Candidate.ward = (select id from Ward where name = 'Bishopsworth');


7. How successful (in % of votes cast) was the Green party in each ward?
You do not need to sort the results. The 2014 solution is (one row per ward):

Avonmouth 4.3772
Bedminster 22.4605
...         ...
Windmill Hill 24.0964

first just print name of ward and number of votes for green party 

select Ward.name, Candidate.votes 

select id, name, party, ward, votes from Candidate where Candidate.party = (select id from Party where Party.name = 'Green');

get all wards and their votes for green party. 

select Ward.name, Candidate.votes from Ward, Candidate where Ward.id = Candidate.ward and Candidate.party = (select id from Party where Party.name = 'Green');


make new column - votes/ that ward total votes. 

divide by (select sum(votes) from Candidate where Ward.id = (that specific ward id)


select Ward.name, Candidate.votes from Ward, Candidate;
